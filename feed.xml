&lt;p&gt;During Fall 2018, I work as a Head Teaching Assistant for Georgia Tech's graduate-level Artificial Intelligence course (CS6601).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work closely with Dr. Thad Starner (inventor of Google Glass and Symbiotic AI pioneer) helping him prepare, run and improve the course. I lead a team of 13 Graduate Teaching Assistants and I am responsible for 590 graduate students (140 on-campus, 450 online).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started as a Graduate Teaching Assistant in Spring 2018, and became a Head TA a semester later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Summer of 2018 I interned with Amway's R&amp;D, working on mobile Augmented Reality (AR) applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My job was to explore Augmented Reality as a technology and find possible use cases for Amway. To that end, I designed and developed 2 AR prototypes focused on interactive packaging. In one of those apps, animated characters would jump out of their box and interact with the users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal was to enhance the &lt;i&gt;Amway experience&lt;/i&gt; by adding a digital extension to Amway packages. I worked on both the social/promotional aspect of Augmented Reality as well as the immersive/entertaining one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internship involved a final presentation, where I pitched my work and its importance to approximately 100 Amway employees (management, marketing, etc.). The presentation included live demos of the prototypes and an extensive Q&amp;A session. The project was received very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;formattingtext&quot;&gt;Tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I developed 2 &lt;b&gt;iOS&lt;/b&gt; applications, using &lt;b&gt;Obj-C&lt;/b&gt; (not Swift, because of Vuforia limitations). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AR applications were built on the &lt;b&gt;Vuforia&lt;/b&gt; AR library, and on a combination of &lt;b&gt;OpenGL ES&lt;/b&gt; &amp; &lt;b&gt;Scenekit&lt;/b&gt; for 3D rendering. Additional tools like &lt;b&gt;Blender&lt;/b&gt; were also utilized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the best part of my time here in Georgia Tech I have worked with &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qr8Vo9IAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;Dr. Thad Starner&lt;/a&gt; as a researcher in Head Mounted Displays. Thad is a great mentor; he's a Georgia Tech Professor, the director of the Contextual Computing Group and the Technical Lead on Google Glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with Thad, Charu Thomas, Pramod Kotipalli and Sarthak Srinivas we've been exploring the disruptive potential of Head Mounted Displays in the Warehousing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 &gt;Why Warehouses?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The rise of Head Mounted Displays will inevitably impact all industries that rely on human labor. More than 55% of the operational costs of a warehouse are spent in a process called 'Order Picking', where employees travel around the warehouse collecting items and fulfilling customer orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the highly specialized nature of this task, it is a task still largely done manually. The industry standard right now involves &lt;i&gt;pickers&lt;/i&gt; carrying paper lists or handheld barcode scanners, both solutions being far from ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/googleglass.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Google Glass&quot; style=&quot;width: 70%&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head Mounted Displays have the potential to revolutionize Order Picking since they allow pickers to have both hands free for the actual picking task. They can provide navigation services, highlight the items on the racks for easier picking and much more.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My contribution to the field involves two projects; one focused on RFID wearables for verification and one tackling in-doors navigation. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 &gt;Heads Up Displays with RFID verification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heads Up Displays have already been proven to increase picking speed. They still, however, face a big challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/hud-rfid-collage.jpg#full&quot; alt=&quot;hud-rfid-collage&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When pickers scan item locations with a barcode scanner, the Warehouse Management System (WMS) verifies that they're picking the correct item saving them from potential errors. Heads Up Displays lack such a verification system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal was to give an answer to this shortcoming by utilizing wearable RFID bands. The bands would recognize passive RFID tags located near bins, and would seamlessly verify a pick, returning positive or negative results straight to the HUD (Google Glass). We developed and tested our method against current industry standards (pick-by-paper, pick-to-light, pick-by-barcode).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/hud-rfid-layout.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;HUD-RFID-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We conducted a 12 person user study in a model warehouse and found our method to be faster, less prone to errors and less taxing to the users than all methods currently used in the industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work was published in the International Symbosium on Wearable Computers (ISWC '18), in Singapore, with the title- &lt;i&gt;&quot;RF-Pick: Comparing Order Picking Using a HUD with Wearable RFID Verification to Traditional Pick Methods&quot;&lt;/i&gt; and was awarded with the &lt;b&gt;Best Paper Award&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 &gt;In-doors Navigation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reducing picking time and errors only solves part of the problem. 50% of the time and thus the cost of Order Picking is spent in-between picks, when a picker is walking from one location to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal was to reduce the travelling time by means of optimization and navigation. Warehouses are complicated structures and can become very crowded and very hectic. A navigation system, like an in-doors &lt;i&gt;Maps&lt;/i&gt; application, can help pickers traverse the Warehouse more quickly and more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal was not to design an in-doors Real Time Location System (RTLS) since such systems already exist. Instead, we focused on the client application that would run on a Heads Up Display. Ultimately we wanted to investigate whether such a Navigation system could reduce travelling time and by what amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/navigation-library.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Navigation Project in library&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tested our method in Georgia Tech's library. We gave subjects a list of books either in a paper form or directly to the HUD, and they would have to pick them and fulfill the order. Our goal was to determine whether HUD with Navigation could actually reduce the time wasted in between picks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study is still on-going.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Theo Panagiotopoulos</name></author><category term="projects" /><category term="work" /><summary type="html">For the best part of my time here in Georgia Tech I have worked with Dr. Thad Starner as a researcher in Head Mounted Displays.

These single-mesh lattice structures have a variety of uses in the medical field. They can be 3D printed and inserted into the human body to support a vain or a damaged organ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jDTrdmlcgTU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the process we followed given two arbitrary planar point clouds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We first triangulate (Delaunay) the two point clouds and generate two parallel planar surfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We then implement Delaunay Tetrahedralization to fill the space in between the two planes with tetrahedra primitives.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We use the edges of the tetrahedra as support beams for our lattice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally, we use the ball-pivoting algorithm to generate a single 3D mesh from all the primitives. This step is crucial since it allows 3D printing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We redesigned the Ball Pivoting algorithm, bringing some crucial steps of the algorithm to O(n) time complexity from O(n&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
