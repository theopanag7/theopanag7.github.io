                    <p>The goal of this project was to generate a custom 3D lattice support structure in between two arbitrary surfaces. These single-mesh lattice structures have a variety of uses in the medical field. They can be 3D printed and inserted into the human body to support a vain or a damaged organ.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jDTrdmlcgTU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Here's the process we followed given two arbitrary planar point clouds:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We first triangulate (Delaunay) the two point clouds and generate two parallel planar surfaces.</li>
  <li>We then implement Delaunay Tetrahedralization to fill the space in between the two planes with tetrahedra primitives.</li>
  <li>We use the edges of the tetrahedra as support beams for our lattice.</li>
  <li>Finally, we use the ball-pivoting algorithm to generate a single 3D mesh from all the primitives. This step is crucial since it allows 3D printing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Project completed by me and Sandeep Bangalore at Georgia Tech, Atlanta.</p>
