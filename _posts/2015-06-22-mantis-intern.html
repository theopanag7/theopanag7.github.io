<p>During the Summers of 2015 and 2016 I interned with Mantis Informatics S.A. as a Software Engineer, developing Augmented Reality applications for Head Mounted Displays.</p>

<p>Mantis Informatics is an international company located in Athens, Greece, specializing in Warehouse Management Systems (WMS). Read on how Head Mounted Displays are going to impact the Warehousing industry <a href="/hud-rfid">here</a>.</p>

<p>My role was to design Augmented Reality applications that would help Warehouse employees perform their everyday tasks. The applications were developed for Head Mounted Displays like the Vuzix M100 and the Moverio BT-200.</p>

<p>Some of the questions my prototypes helped answer where:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Do we need additional hardware to achieve effective tracking?</li>
	<li>Is an RTLS (Real Time Location System) required?</li>
	<li>Is the Head Mounted Display industry ready? Are the devices comfortable? What's the battery life? Cost? Heat-management?</li>
	<li>Is registered AR required? Or can the same results be achieved with a Heads Up Display, like the Google Glass or the Vuzix M100?</li>
</ul>
