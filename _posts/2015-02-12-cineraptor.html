CineRaptor is a Social Media Platform for movie fans. Users can share, review, discover and archive movies they like, while at the same time, keep in touch with their friends (or cinephiles). CineRaptor is connected with the International Movie Database (IMDb), allowing users to be completely up to date with the latest movie releases. IMDb guarantees that a user can find any movie ever released.

CineRaptor was created using html, css, javascript, php, sql, json and other web technologies and tools. Special care was given to the graphical interface, the user experience and the underlying functionality. It started as a university project (2015) for the course ‘Web Development’, but later took a life of its own.

This project is still a prototype with limited functionality.
