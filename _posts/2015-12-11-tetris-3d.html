<p>“3D Tetris” is a 3D, Virtual reality remake of the classic video game Tetris. The goal of the project was to create a smooth, fun and easy to use version of Tetris for the Virtual Reality world.</p>

<p>This university project (2016) served as an introduction to 3D Rendering & Graphics, as well as  to more advanced Virtual Reality concepts. No external libraries where used, just C++ and OpenGL. This helped me get a better understanding of advanced Graphics concepts. The resulting game is a standalone one with its own music, GUI, high scores and tutorials.</p>

<p>It was not a project devoid of challenges. The 3D world is obviously a lot more complicated than its 2D counterpart. Intuitions that seemed obvious in the original Tetris, like understanding where exactly your piece is going to land, where not so obvious in the 3D version. To help the player better visualize the game board, I created a transparent avatar of the active tile, which always hang in the bottom of the board, showing exactly where the tile was going to land. Using different, vivid colors, for the tiles also helped the player understand the geometry.</p>

<p>But the most challenging aspect of all was the rotation complexity. In the original, 2D game, the user can rotate each piece clockwise or counter-clockwise, but the rotation is always on one axis. In the 3D version, this 1 rotational axis (Z), corresponds to 3 different rotational axes (XYZ), which make the game too complicated for the average user.</p>

<p>To counter this difficulty, I implemented a control system with gestures, which made the whole experience a lot more intuitive for the human brain, allowing the player to navigate the game, and perform the rotations almost subconsciously. A tutorial was also created to allow the user to experiment with the game before being thrown into the arena.</p>

<p>“3D Tetris”, is a 6-month university related project, completed in January of 2016, for the course ‘3D Graphics and Virtual Reality‘. The project was featured in <a href="http://www.vvr.ece.upatras.gr/index.php/en/studies/undergraduate-projects">the Lab’s (VVR) website</a> and was part of a promotional video reel shown to undergraduates who where keen to join the CS specialization.</p>

<p>It was developed with C++ and OpenGL, also utilizing Oculus Rift’s API.</p>
