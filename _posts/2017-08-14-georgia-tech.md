I'm currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science. I will be graduating on May 2019.

I'm specializing in Computer Graphics and Vision and I am currently working with [Dr. Thad Starner](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qr8Vo9IAAAAJ&hl=en) both in [Research](/hud-rfid) and as a [Head TA](/head-ta) in the Artificial Intelligence course.
