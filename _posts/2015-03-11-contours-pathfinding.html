<p>‘Contour Segmentation and Terrain Pathfinding‘, was a university project for the course ‘Computational Geometry’, taken in 2015. The project's goal was to triangulate a contour map and generate its 3D representation. Pathfinding Search Algorithms were then implemented on the generated terrain. It was developed solely on C++, using a vvr’s graphics framework, so no OpenGL.</p>

<p>The project’s main task was the Triangulation of the Contours. For a 3D model to be rendered on our screen, it needs to have an underlying triangle representation. Every digital asset we see is constructed from thousands of individual triangles. The process which creates all these triangles is called triangulation, and the triangulation of a contour map is still a problem largely unsolved.</p>

<p>In this project I developed a novel method which first segmented the contours, then categorized them, and finally triangulated each one individually. Once the basic triangulation was complete, a post-processing phase would smoothen the terrain and increase the representation accuracy.</p>

<p>By connecting the centers of all the triangles, a 3D Graph would be generated, upon which I would test several search algorithms, like A*, Best-First, Uniform-Cost, Dijkstra etc. By removing parts of the Graph that where too steep, we would then be able to test these algorithms in a Pathfinding context.</p>
