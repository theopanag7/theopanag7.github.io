[Ancient Conquest](http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?640167-Ancient-Conquest-v1-0-Full-Release) is a game modification for SEGA’s [Medieval II Total War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_II:_Total_War), one of the most celebrated strategy games of all time. The original game is set in the Middle Ages, and the player’s goal, is to take the reins of a Medieval Kingdom and bring glory to its people.

Ancient Conquest is a complete overhaul of SEGA’s title, as it takes the player back to the Ancient Era, where Greeks and Persians, Egyptians and Romans all fought for control of the Mediterranean.

* The whole map has been redesigned. The geography has been altered, the mountain ranges redrawn and the whole economic system re-balanced. New nations have been added, along with new religions and mechanics to provide a smoother gaming experience.

* New design assets have been introduced to match the historical setting. There are new 3D models, animations, textures, 2d art and even a brand new GUI and Soundtrack. 

* Various design tools like Adobe Photoshop, Autodesk 3ds Max, Gimp were used in the creative process.

* Total War’s scripting tools have been utilized to alter the mechanics of the game, and python scripts have also been used for external tasks (file conversions, automated image processing etc.)

* Extensive historical research has been done, to present the Ancient Era with outmost historical accuracy.


The main goal of this mod, was to venture to the previously unexplored Total War area of Hotseat Multiplayer. Trying to impress Total War fans head on, with a richer, more grandiose production would not work, as there were other teams in the field, far larger, more experienced and better established. So for this mod we created something unique. A relatively minimal multiplayer experience, completely bug-free and user friendly, that would engage the player in a different kind of gameplay. A gameplay that would not require fancy special effects and whole teams of designers working on animations.

This approach met unexpected success and appreciation from the community. Ancient Conquest amassed more than 5.000 individual downloads, launching many new hotseat campaigns and 2 independent spin-off mods. Its trailer video, and a previous campaign got more than half a million views on youtube, and a lot of blog posts and reviews.
