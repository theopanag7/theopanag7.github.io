<div style="text-align: justify;">

<p>During the Summer of 2018 I interned with Amway's R&D, working on mobile Augmented Reality (AR) applications.</p>

<p>My job was to explore Augmented Reality as a technology and find possible use cases for Amway. To that end, I designed and developed 2 AR prototypes focused on interactive packaging.</p>

<p>My goal was to enhance the <i>Amway experience</i> by adding a digital extension to Amway packages. I worked on both the social/promotional aspect of Augmented Reality as well as the immersive/entertaining one.</p>

<p>The internship involved a final presentation, where I pitched my work and its importance to approximately 100 Amway employees (management, marketing, etc.). The presentation included live demos of the prototypes and an extensive Q&A session. The project was received very well.</p>

<h3 id="formattingtext">Tools</h3>
<br>
<p>I developed 2 <b>iOS</b> applications, using <b>Obj-C</b> (not Swift, because of library limitations). </p>
<p>The AR applications were built on the <b>Vuforia</b> AR library, and on a combination of <b>OpenGL ES</b> & <b>Scenekit</b> for 3D rendering. Additional tools like <b>Blender</b> were also utilized.</p>
