<p>During Fall 2018, I work as a Head Teaching Assistant for Georgia Tech's graduate-level Artificial Intelligence course (CS6601).</p>

<p>I work closely with Dr. Thad Starner, inventor of Google Glass and Symbiotic AI pioneer, helping him prepare, run and improve the course. I lead a team of 13 Graduate Teaching Assistants and I am responsible for 590 graduate students (140 on-campus, 450 online).</p>

<p>I started as a Graduate Teaching Assistant in Spring 2018, and became a Head TA a semester later.</p>
