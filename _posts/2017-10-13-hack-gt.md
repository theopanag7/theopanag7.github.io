Our [Card-Cache application](https://github.com/theopanag7/card-cache) won the 1st prize in the Career App challenge in the Hack GT 2017 Hackathon.

Card-Cache is a mobile app which can detect business cards, parse them, translate them and save them in your e-wallet!

Our team consisted of 4 people. My responsibilities were to handle the Computer Vision aspects of the app (detection, parsing and translation).
