I graduated from the [University of Patras](http://www.upatras.gr/en) in 2016, with a B.E. in Electrical & Computer Engineering.

An Engineering Degree in Greece is a 5 year program with a 2 year specialization. My specialization was in Electronics & Computers and my [Thesis was in Augmented Reality](/ar-3d-maps).

During my 4th and 5th year, I worked in the [VVR lab](http://www.vvr.ece.upatras.gr/index.php/en/) under the supervision of [Konstantinos Moustakas](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?hl=en&user=E361geAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) working in Computer Vision and Computer Graphics projects. You can find samples of my work [here](/contours-pathfinding) and [here](/tetris-3d).

I graduated in the top 12% of my class with a 7.82/10 grade. I was also in the 3% that managed to finish the degree in the 5 year time-frame.
